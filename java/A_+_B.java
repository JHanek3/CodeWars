// Vasya Pupkin just started learning Java and C#. At first, he decided to write simple program that was supposed to sum up two small numbers 
// (numbers and their sum fit in a byte), but it didn't work. 
// Vasya was too sad to find out what is wrong. Help him to correct the mistake.

// public class FirstClass {
//   public static int sum (int a, int b) {
//       int c = (a + b);
//       return c;
//   }
// }

// I think this is what I was suppose to do, downcast the byte
// public class FirstClass {
//   public static byte sum (byte a, byte b) {
//       return (byte)(a + b);
      
//   }
// }
